* Squidbot's Brain

This is the core logic service that contains all of the modules that react to
the various delivery frontends. Which modules you end up using is exposed via a
TOML file called `config.toml`.

** Squidbot's Design

Squidbot is a modular bot architecture written in Go, and designed to run on a
kubernetes cluster. In my case, it's a stack of six Raspberry Pi 3 boards, with
an Intel NUC running as the master.
